Monitoring
----------

Having a message queue where it is not possible to know what is in the queue and the
contents of the messages is not very handy, so for that there is `Juno <https://github.com/henrikbjorn/Juno>`_.

It is implemented in Silex and is very lightweight. Also if needed, it can be
embedded in other Silex or Flint applications.
